Last revised on 1/19/25 by Managament

1.1: Restricted In Roleplay
There will be no racism tolerated during roleplay whatsoever. This includes slang words that can be considered offensive to some.

Verbal Harassment: Homophobic, racial, or gender offensive slurs of any kind can and likely will result in a ban. Slurs against nationality are also not tolerated.

Erotic/Sexual RP is not permitted. It does not matter if it's consensual or away from others. Please do not do it. This will result in a permanent ban.

Gruesome RP: such as torture RP (unless with consent from the other party and permission from Staff) is not tolerated. It can be considered powergaming.

Mental Health RP will not be tolerated. This includes self-harm, suicide, and other mental health issues such as abuse/trauma.

Downloadable Mods/Graphic Packs:
All Day/Night packs are NOT allowed, as well as any other graphic packs that get rid of Foliage and/or Entities in the City, or otherwise give you an advantage over other players.

There will only be ONE warning about this. After that, it will just result in a permanent ban.

1.2: Interaction Timer
Before any hostile actions can be taken, there MUST be at least 3 minutes of an interaction.

We also ask that there be LEGITIMATE RP REASONING behind why you perform hostile actions. PM wants to see in-depth RP. Roleplay Over Gunplay! Please do not just interact with someone, solely with the intent of injuring/killing them the moment the interaction timer concludes. This is viewed as LQRP, even FRP, and will result in disciplinary action.

1.3: Random Deathmatch (RDM)
Defined as killing/attempting to kill without reasonable intent and reasonable roleplay.

Player Initiation: When initiating, you must make the player aware of the intent of roleplay while being in plain view of the player. While initiating, you must allow the other player to react/respond to your roleplay with words or actions before engaging. If a player is engaged in an animation/menu, you must give them ample time to react/respond before continuing.

Vehicle Initiation: If you forcefully engage with someone while driving, the player initiation rule becomes invalid.

Group Initiation: While with a group of other civilians, to properly initiate as a group, at least one person needs to express the intentions of the entire group. Just as the player initiation states, before engaging everyone must be in plain view and enough time must be given for a reaction/response. Anyone not on the scene in question when the group initiation has been declared, must initiate.

1.4: Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM)
Defined as using a vehicle to kill/attempt to kill without reasonable intent and reasonable roleplay.

There are only TWO exceptions to this rule:
- If you are fleeing a dangerous scene, and one of your attackers steps in front of your vehicle, and you have no other choice but to run over them.
- If an accident occurs, roleplaying out of the scene properly will negate the rulebreak.
  This means pulling over and checking whether the individual is okay or in need of medical assistance, etc.

1.5: Metagaming
The act of using out-of-character/external information to influence your or other civilians' in-game decisions.

This includes, but is not limited to:
Stream sniping
Using information learned from streams
Information from 3rd party applications (discord or any other external voice/text application)
Information learned from your other characters (warrants, locations, city features, contacts, etc.)

Using any of the above information in a way that meets the standards of metagaming will be met with disciplinary action up to, and including, a ban from the server. Exceptions to external information are items handled in discord in an official RP capacity such as department complaints or DOJ court cases.

1.6: Powergaming
Power-gaming is the act of using an in-game mechanic or a roleplay concept to favor your own character or story and give yourself an unfair or unrealistic advantage. This applies to you whether you are a law abiding citizen, cop, or criminal. Please note the 10 minute rule.

The following are just some examples of power-gaming:
Carrying a player while driving a vehicle or operating a motorcycle.
Entering your apartment/house to evade LEOs or criminals.
Driving while cuff'd

Vehicle Modifications
Repairing your vehicle and continuing to use it during a scene, this includes LEO vehicles. Changing the color of, or pulling a vehicle out of a garage within 5 minutes of committing a crime, or pulling a vehicle out while in an active chase (it's best practice to have get-away vehicles staged prior to committing a crime/beginning a scene).

Robberies
Robbing a person, bank, bank truck, or heist etc. then depositing the money into the bank, pulling a vehicle from a garage to stash the stolen items, or stashing it in a house within 10 minutes of pocketing the items.

Person Modification
Changing the clothing you're wearing within 5 minutes of committing a crime. This includes removing clothing without having a bag to carry the clothing in. If you choose to remove clothing items, the Skybox should be utilized for RP purposes.

Medical AI Ambulance
Utilizing the AI Ambulance when there is active SAMS, SASP, or SACO personnel on duty, is NOT permitted, unless they tell you to do so.

If the downed timer has expired and forces a respawn, you can utilize the AI Ambulance if the situation allows. If the time has expired, and there are other parties still present, meaning the scene is still active, you should NOT utilize AI Ambulance.

Performance modification
Using any narcotics, edibles, energy drinks to boost your performance outside of a vehicle following a vehicle pursuit. If you chose to use these modifiers, you may do so INSIDE of the vehicle before exiting on foot in the event of running, but not during

1.7: Exploiting
This is considered any method used to gain something outside of what the "typical" result is meant to be. Anything that Staff feel is exploiting, will be met with a no appeal, permanent ban.

Knowingly exploiting a script and/or the GTA V engine in order to gain an advantage is not allowed. This includes abusing the mechanics of GTA V in order to do unrealistic things, which includes but is not limited to:
- AFK Grinding / Money Making
- Weapon / Money / Item Duplication
- Using Mods to gain an advantage
- /Carry'ing someone while downed, just to drop them through the map

PLEASE NOTE: Having knowledge of someone who is exploiting or even knowing of an exploit and not reporting it to Staff is also a bannable offense. Withholding information regarding exploits will be met with the same punishment as those who exploited the systems themselves.

1.8: Combat Logging
This is defined as exiting your game in any fashion to avoid RP.

Combat Logging comes in many forms, but examples are as listed:
Exiting the server to avoid interactions with LEOs or other parties,,
Exiting the server to avoid losing inventory items,,
Exiting the server or seeing the light during an active scene.

Logging off or forcibly re-spawning to avoid situations is not allowed. IF you have to log off, but are in the middle of an RP situation, you will need acknowledgment from all parties involved. This includes LEOs chases and/or medical scenes. If you know you do not have the time to complete a scenario, do not start it. If all parties involved do not agree that the scene should be ended and you log out it will be considered combat logging and be dealt with accordingly.

Once you commit a crime, you must wait 10 minutes before logging out of the server.

1.9: Disconnects/Crashes
If you are in the middle of a scene and your game crashes, or something causes you to suddenly leave, please send a message in the 『‼️』disconnections thread in our Discord, tagging/informing all parties involved in what happened.
( Have clipping software on at all times! )

If you cannot get back within 5 minutes, please create a ticket with a valid reason as to why that is the case, and whom you were involved with during your scene, so we can notify them of the issue. Otherwise, you could be met with disciplinary actions regarding Combat Logging.
NOTE: Combat Logging and or disconnecting while dead will result in an inventory wipe.

1.10: Interactions Between Yours Characters
Your personal characters cannot know each other from an in-character perspective. You are also not allowed to interact between the two characters by transferring money or any other assets between your characters, or using a third-party "friend" to transfer items between your characters.

If this is discovered, those items will be deleted from your inventory and you will receive disciplinary action.

1.11: Going Out of Character
Make sure you stay in character AT ALL TIMES.

If you are in a situation where a rule has been broken, continue with the scene. You can report any issues to Staff once the scene is finished, by opening a ticket in city utilizing /report and expecting a response if an Admin is available. You can also submit a Player Report ticket via Discord. Whichever route is taken, you must be able to provide a clip. (3-minute minimum)

Do NOT under any circumstances meet rulebreaks with rulebreaks of your own, as both parties will be punished. Do NOT create a report/ticket just because you didn't like the outcome of a scene. There are few exceptions to this rule such as: Cheating, Mass VDMing, Sexual Harassment, etc.

1.12: Failed Roleplay
FRP is defined as not roleplaying realistically.

Failing to roleplay is strictly forbidden. Please treat your character as if you are in that character's skin, and only do what you would in the realistic world.

Examples of FRP are as follows, but not limited to:
Illegal activities in or around LEOs stations
Fake hostages
Using the swap seat function to prevent a player from entering the driver seat, or removing you from vehicles.
Disrupting/Injecting yourself into an ongoing scene which you were not involved in from the start
Talking while downed on your side, as if you have not just sustained a critical injury
Jumping off a building or parking garage, then running off instead of RPing out an injury
Being ejected from a vehicle or off a motorcycle, then running off instead of RPing out an injury
Being tased or beanbagged multiple times, then fighting or running off from LEOs
Using /me when flatbacked, outside of communicating extent of injuries

FRP will result in quick disciplinary actions. No questions asked.

1.13: Low-Quality Roleplay (LQRP)
LQRP is taking actions throughout scenes or situations that could be seen as harmful or unnecessary to any roleplaying scenario. Scenes with LQRP can result in a warning or further disciplinary actions if LQRP is consistently performed.

Examples include but are not limited to:
Harassing new civilians because they are new civilians
Roleplaying your injuries incorrectly
Robbing/Killing with no reason or without roleplaying
Consistently using the same shootout location within a short amount of time
Being part of a scene, but refusing to roleplay with civilians involved in said scene
Speaking normally while being incapacitated or injured
Driving up to a crime scene to aid someone but not reacting to LEOs presence

1.14: Green Zones
Also known as "Green Grass," Green Zones must be crime-free. This includes instigating violence, selling drugs, robbing, etc. It is Fail RP to run away from a crime and enter a safe zone. If the RP begins outside of the safe zone and is brought into the safe zone you may continue the criminal RP, however, it must be realistic.

Safe Zones:
LEOs Stations are not Green Zones, however there MUST be 10 or more LEOs in-city to break out someone in LEOs Custody.
Hospital Grounds (Inside or in ambulance bay) (no retaliatory crimes)
Prison Parking Lot - no retaliatory crimes, will be treated as a spawn location as mentioned below
Player-Owned Businesses/Events (unless otherwise stated)
Inside Casino
Community Events

Spawn Locations - Spawn locations are SAFE ZONES in which a player must be allowed to move freely from the spawn location after flying in, and have a reasonable amount of time to collect themselves. Spawn locations are not protected when loitering in the area, however.

Exceptions:
LEOs may serve warrants at Green Zones
If LEOs chase you into a GZ, RP may occur naturally.
If roleplay in these areas naturally and justifiably lead to escalation between involved parties, these protections may be voided. However, both parties and the Business Owner must agree to that fact.

1.15: Fear RP
This rule refers to civilians treating situations like real life, their character's life like there's only one to live.
All civilians must value their own life and show concern for safety while in the city (IC).
This is a MUST and NEEDS to be a part of your RP.

If an individual (unarmed with no weapon out) is in immediate danger by an attacker with a weapon (you have a gun pointed at your person, and/or you are outnumbered), they must comply with the attacker's demands. Do not try to be a hero.You should feel as if you may die if this scenario presents itself.

Fear RP shall be followed when the numbers against you are, at minimum, doubled. An example of this would be 2v1, 4v2, 6v3. If there is anything less than this, attempting to escape "at your own risk" is deemed OK. Fear RP with Law enforcement is excluded.

Law Enforcement must follow their own department's escalation of force. When outnumbered by law enforcement, attempting to escape is at your own risk.

Lethal force would also be considered in the numbers. Your Fear RP numbers only count if there is some sort of weapon drawn. If you have 4 people vs. 2 people and only 1 of the 4 has weapons out, this does not count as a 4v2 since only 1 is showing deadly force.

If you are already in your car and someone pulls a gun on you, regardless of numbers, it is acceptable to speed away. At that time, you are taking a chance on being shot/shot at.

If the suspect/s informs you to not touch the radio/phone, to include your panic button, you should comply or die.

If the individual is in a 1v1 scenario where weapons are accessible to the victim, they may fight for their life.

An Individual must fear for their life if they are outnumbered 2:1 even if you are armed.

If there is an active shootout between groups (Gang v Gang/Gang v LEOs) Do not involve yourself or go towards the shots unless the RP Pertains to you or your organization.

As a Citizen or Criminal you should always value the life of others. Taking a life is serious and should only be carried out under reasonable RP circumstances.
SAMS& SAFR should fear for their lives as well and only render aid after the scene is over and LEOs clear the scene.
No Crime should be committed near Government Buildings, as in reality, there would be very slim chances of escaping detainment.

1.16: Not Valuing Life (NVL)
NVL is the act of responding to a dangerous scene in a way that is completely unrealistic and/or puts yourself in imminent harm.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of examples of this rule break:
Blatantly not fearing for your life.

Committing a violent act against a group that has you outnumbered and/or has already shown their intent to do harm.

Fleeing when surrounded by a group that has communicated that they will do harm, including law enforcement that have escalated to lethal force.

Jumping from a fatal height to flee.

Remaining in the area of an ongoing shoutout in such a way that puts you in danger.

Failing to comply with reasonable demands when your life's on the line
Breaking this rule will result in immediate disciplinary action.

1.17: Injury RP
Downed Status: When a player is injured and downed (lying on their side), they must roleplay their injuries based on the nature of the injury received, such as gunshot wounds, tripping and falling, vehicle accidents, etc. What we mean by this, don't be downed on your side, and trash-talking, or talking as if you're not injured.

Being "Flat-Backed": When a player is injured and downed (laying on their back), they must roleplay their injuries as unconscious & critically injured on the verge of death if not transported and treated at a Hospital. Civilians should not communicate with anyone at this time, including the use of /me.

Vehicle Accidents: Vehicle accidents must be roleplayed, to an extent. This means, if you crash into a brick wall going 85 mph+, don't just hop out of the vehicle and run or spark a shootout. This would not realistically happen.
Use of Ambulance AI: [COMING SOON]

PLEASE NOTE:
You may not use this command when:
Involved in an ongoing scene, meaning the scene is still active.
To avoid being arrested by LEOs, or RP with other civilians.

Any abuse of this command will result in disciplinary action such as individuals being pocket-wiped and/or catching bans, up to even a removal of the command altogether.

1.18: New Life Rule (PMR)
If a scene concluded with you being left on your side, you may remember everything.

You may OPMY speak and/or RP out your injuries when on your side, NOT flat-backed.
( This includes /ME )

However, civilians are NOT allowed to remember anything from scenes, 15 mins prior to the moment they become flat-backed.

Please also note that bragging on social media and other in city measures will result in a player being able to remember what you have done to them. Tweeting "Have fun with the fishes," etc. would result in the player being able to remember what you have done to them.

1.19: GTA Driving
GTA Driving is NOT tolerated. This includes driving off of high places such as roofs, highways, mountains in any scenario, or taking a sports car up the side of a mountain. Keep it realistic.

If you wouldn't drive your own vehicle IRL in such a fashion, don't do it in-city either.

1.20: Rooftop Shooting
At this time, rooftop shooting is permitted. However, if it becomes an issue within the community, we will no longer allow it. So, it is advised that you choose appropriate moments to do this, and not abuse it, or constantly do it.

1.21: Griefing
Continuously harassing a player multiple scenes in a row is NOT permitted.

If someone disrespects you and/or steps on your toes, you are NOT allowed to go after them time and time again. They MUST give you a reason each time after the first.

We expect good RP when beefing with other civilians within the city.

1.22: Robbing
When it comes to robbing civilians, we are not a 100K or Die server, and do not believe in robbing civilians constantly and just because you can.

There must be a legitimate reason to rob someone. A legitimate reason is NOT "I am a gangster," or "I needed money," or even "They hit my car." These are just a few examples of terrible reasons to rob someone.

Robbing a player should always have a very good roleplay reason behind it, and all parties involved should know and understand why the robbery is taking place.

When robbing civilians, you can OPMY ROB the person of what is on their person.
This means that vehicles, properties/MLOs, are OFF LIMITS.

Things that can be robbed include: cash, phones, or any illegal contraband, such as dirty money, drugs, weapons, ammo, armor.

Legal items, such as IDs, food/water, etc, should NOT be stolen.

You CANNOT make a player go to a bank and take out cash or transfer money to your account. This will result in a permanent ban.

SAMS, SAFR, and LEOs CANNOT BE ROBBED. They are NOT loot boxes.

There are a few exceptions regarding LEOs however, which include the recovery of evidence taken off your person related to an ongoing scene, their bodycams, radios, and phones.

You CANNOT steal SAMS or SAFR Vehicles nor loot them for medical supplies.

You may OPMY steal a LEO Vehicle as a last effort escape option, and IF you are DIRECTLY involved in that scene. However, you may NOT loot or steal items from the vehicle.

SWAT/ERT Vehicles are NOT allowed to be stolen!

Looting LEO Vehicles will result in disciplinary actions.

1.23: Robberies/Heists
Robbers CANNOT take a friend(s) hostage, one of the robbers cannot pose as a hostage, or have a fake hostage. The Robbers must go out and find a random person and take them hostage for these scenarios.

There is technically no limit on hostages, however you must be able to manage the amount of hostages you have.

Robbers - your scene must be set up before starting the robbery. You can not start the robbery and then add people to it or show up later with the hostage. You MUST have a backpack/or bag on your person while conducting the robbery, this "shows" in RP where you are putting the items you are stealing.

Negotiations can be conducted by radio or phone between the LEOs and robbers.

Taking hostages with you from a scene is NOT ALLOWED. Know that LEOs will take action to prevent this from happening.

Robbers can ask for demands during negotiations (LEOs not pursuing and taking the hostage from the scene is not an option).

1.24: Hostage-Taking
Taking a civilian hostage is only for quality roleplay.
You must NOT keep a hostage for more than ONE scene.

Hostages CAN be exchanged for people in LEOs custody prior to them being sentenced.

If a ransom is being requested in exchange for the hostage, the hostage MUST be exchanged for the money.

Do NOT take a hostage to LEOs or elsewhere, and demand that your friend be released from custody.

It is frowned upon to take civilians hostage who are working businesses. Those businesses need their employees there to make it run. Please try everything in your power to get hostages from other places.

There shall be NO FAKE HOSTAGES, meaning, you cannot ask a friend to be a hostage, in exchange for loot or pay. The same applies for random civilians. RP actually taking someone at gunpoint, and forcing them against their will.

If it is discovered that fake hostages are being utilized, there will be disciplinary actions.

There is no limit on how many hostages you can have for a scene, however you must realistically be able to manage the amount of hostages you have.

Civilians may only be taken hostage when there is a minimum of 4 LEOs on-duty.
LEOs may only be taken hostage when there is a minimum of 10 LEOs on-duty.

SAMS & SAFR personnel are NOT ALLOWED TO BE TAKEN HOSTAGE.

1.25: Scene Limitations
Limitations have been put in place to prevent both LEOs & Criminals from being consistently outnumbered/overwhelmed, while still allowing room for creativity within your scenarios.

PLEASE NOTE: An Air Support Unit (consisting of a Pilot and Co-Pilot) counts as one LEO.
The above guidelines for how many LEOs max can be on a scene OPMY APPLIES for the first 10 minutes of each scene. After that allotted time expires, any additional units needed may respond to the scene.

HOSTAGE DEMANDS
Crims are permitted 2 demands for 1 hostage.
Any additional hostages after that, Crims are permitted 1 additional demand.
[i.e.: 2 Hostages = 3 Demands (2 for the first one + 1 additional for the 2nd)]
Crims may only request no AIR OR no HEAT. They cannot request both to NOT be on scene.
LEOs will honor demands, just as long as they are reasonable.
PLEASE NOTE: Criminals need to ensure that a hostage's life is under constant threat (meaning gun should constantly be pointed at the hostage). Your mere presence with a gun is not seen as a constant threat by LEOs.
If LEOs (meaning their ERT) decide to breach a location, you submit a ticket about them not valuing a hostage's life, but it is seen in the clip that you did not have a gun actively on the hostage, your ticket will be closed with no response.

1.26: City Heist Cooldown
PLEASE NOTE:
There should be NO robberies/heists being started 15 minutes before Tsunami, or for the first 15 minutes after Tsunami.

Most of these scenes will last for 15 minutes or longer, making it nearly impossible for them to be completed within 15 minutes of an upcoming Tsunami.

Following Tsunamis, we utilize the first 15 minutes to allow both Crims and LEOs alike to gather themselves, getting all the supplies they need, parties together, and vehicles in check.

Please respect this rule, or there could be disciplinary action.

Other Rules w/LEOs
1.27: Cop Baiting
Cop Baiting is strictly prohibited.

Do not purposefully try to get LEO attention on you by doing things you would not do realistically with a Trooper/Deputy near you. This includes burning out in the middle of intersections, purposefully revving your motor at lights to bait a pullover/chase, and purposely committing traffic violations in the vicinity of LEOs.

No one wants RP forced on them. Let it occur naturally.

1.28: Impersonating Personnel
Citizens are prohibited from impersonating emergency personnel or whitelisted departments, this includes, but is not limited to: LEOs, SAMS, SAFR, the Department of Justice, even Staff.

Wearing any clothing items containing white listed department logos, LEOs issued clothing, law enforcement style hats, on a character not actively employed in that department is not permitted..... The only exception is when citizens are actively participating in a department ride along and a high visibility department vest is required to be worn.

Wearing a Judge robe and acting as a Judge is also not permitted.

1.29: Scene Interruptions with LEOs
Any time a scene is interrupted due to a player, whether LEO or Crim, crashing or as a result of a Tsunami, said scene must be paused, and resumed upon return.

The only exception to this rule, for example, if there is a police chase and other LEOs are involved and another disconnects, the scene does not have to be paused.

1.30: Use of Force
USE OF FORCE GUIDELINES
LEOs will match the same force of criminals. (i.e. pistol vs pistol, AR vs AR).
However, LEOs are authorized to escalate their force when met with greater numbers, when responding to Officer Down calls, big bank robberies/heists, hostage situations, or mass casualty events.

LEO scenes may be third-partied, however, one must come up with an intelligent plan and execute it in the proper ways. DO NOT show up and shoot LEOs. Focus mainly on pickups, car switches, tackling, barricades, distractions, etc..

LEOs, SAMS, and SAFR are NOT ALLOWED to sell any job-related items or evidence, under NO CIRCUMSTANCES!

This is considered LEO, SAMS, and SAFR corruption, which in PM is a permanent ban.
